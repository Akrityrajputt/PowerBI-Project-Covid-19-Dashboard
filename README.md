# PowerBI-Project-Covid-19-Dashboard
This project aims to build a COVID-19 dashboard to analyze cases and deaths over time, identify patterns, plot weekly averages, and compare country-wise cases. It includes a monthly filter, a map chart for case intensity, a WHO region-country hierarchy, and identifies the most affected regions for insightful decision-making.
